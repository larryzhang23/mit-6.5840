# Implementation of MIT 6.5840 course, spring 2025 version.
* Here is the course [website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)

* **DO NOT LOOK AT IT** if you enroll the course. It is for someone who follows the course at home to refer to.

* Lab3 to Lab 5(Part A to C) are all tested at least 250 times. Lab 5 part C fails 1 to 5 times for every 250 tests.
  I believe it is a tester side issue because of the race condition between the partition and the joingroups/leavegroups in the partitionctrler function.
